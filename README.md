Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
-- The goal of the driver pass project was to design a web based application for clents to log in and recieve driver training and practice tests. in addition the application must be accesible by a IT lead for routine maintenance and account resets whenever nessecary.

What did you do particularly well?
-- One part of this project i did well was the use case diagram i had to create for the system.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
-- The main part of my work i would choose revise and improve is my sustems design document. i would improve it by fully completing it.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
-- i interpereted the user needs through transcripts of interviews along with user stories and client expectations. to implement these in my design i kept a check of the requirements anfd crossed them off as i progressed throught the design.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system? 
-- My approach to designing software will involve an adaptive approach. i will start with designing a general approach to the idea of the system. Then make changes in the gameplan as issues arise to prevent further issues. lastly i will use user stories to make the end product as close if not better then what the anticipated user expected.
